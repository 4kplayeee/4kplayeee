## Hi, I'm polo ðŸ‘‹
I'm a French tweak developer who started contributing to the community in [March 2020](https://github.com/RedenticDev/SBColors). I really love programming & have skills in Java, C and many more. Jailbroken since iOS 11 and enjoying tweaks, I thought, "why not starting developing them?", and **here I am**.

### ðŸ™Œ My contribution to the community
I've only done, I only do and will only do *free tweaks*, because I think the community deserves it, and I've only been well received so far. I'm totally open-minded, so don't hesitate to: fork and PR my tweaks, send me suggestions, report bugs & issues, or simply talk with me through my social medias :)

### ðŸŽ¯ My aims
- Free and open-source software
- Making The world a Better Place
- making Free Software For The Community
- Quick support
